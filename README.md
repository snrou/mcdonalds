This project focuses on analyzing customer preferences and behavior at McDonald's through the use of clustering techniques and profiling. The goal is to segment customers into distinct groups based on factors like their visit frequency, age, gender, and their likeliness to prefer certain menu items. The project applies various unsupervised learning techniques such as K-Means Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models to identify customer segments. After segmentation, decision trees are used to better understand the characteristics of each cluster
